### What to do next
* end the game when a wall is hit or the snake runs into itself
* allow the user to restart a game quickly after they get a game over
* make a blackout mode
    * the snake can run into itself but walls still end the game
        * it's difficult because you can't see where you are once the snake is crazy long
            * the game ends when there is no spot to put the food that isn't on the snake
* think of other features a snake game has
* refactor code 

### Done
* get the food to not be placed on top of the snake
